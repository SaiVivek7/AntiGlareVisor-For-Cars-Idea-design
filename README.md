# Anti-Glare-Visor-For-Cars-Idea-

Our project idea is focused on improving the safety and comfort of night-time driving, and there are many different approaches we could take to achieve this goal. By researching existing technologies, developing new innovations, and trying to solve problems such as light coming from incoming vehicles, driver fatigue and discomfort, we can help make driving at night a safer and more enjoyable experience for everyone on the road.
